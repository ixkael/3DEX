===================
 3DEX version 1.0
===================

3DEX is a Fortran package providing programs and functions 
to perform fast Fourier-Bessel decomposition of 3D fields.

It is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, 
but without any warranty. See the GNU General Public 
License for more details.

Please contact the authors if you have any question, 
demand or proposal of new features.

AUTHORS 
-------------------
 Boris Leistedt (boris.leistedt@gmail.com)
 FranÃ§ois Lanusse (francois.lanusse@gmail.com)

REQUIREMENTS 
-------------------
 Healpix (v2.12 or higher)
 and Healpix requirements (cfitsio, etc)

INSTALLATION - HEALPIX-LIKE
-------------------
 Please run the ./configure command.
 It will edit the 'Makefile'
 Then, run 'make' as usual
 'make clean' to delete .o files
 'make tidy' and 'make distclean' to uninstall
 
INSTALLATION WITH CMAKE
-------------------
  'export CFITSIO=/usr/local/lib' to locate cfitsio library (libcfitsio.a)
  'export HEALPIX=/Users/silver/sofware/Healpix_2.20a'  to locate Healpix (Fortran build)
  'mkdir build' to create a temporary directory (name doesn't matter)
  'cd build' to use the correct path
  'cmake ..' to launch cmake in the main project root directory
  'make' to compile and build the F90 tree, libraries and executables
  'make install' to install programs, modules and the library in /bin, /include and /lib

NOTE
-------------------
  The library architecture and the installation scripts
  are directly inspired by the HEALPix package, 
  which is under GPL 3.0 license.
