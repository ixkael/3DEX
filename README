Paper : http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.3591

3DEX is a Fortran/CXX package providing programs and functions 
to perform fast Fourier-Bessel decomposition of 3D fields.

It is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but without
any warranty. See the CeCILL License for more details.

Please contact the authors if you have any question, 
demand or proposal of new features.

REQUIREMENTS 
-------------------
 Working C, Cxx, MPI and Fortran compilers
   For example : cc, cxx, mpicxx, gfortran. 
 CFITSIO  (export CFITSIO=...)
 BLAS     (export BLAS=...)
 LAPACK   (export LAPACK=...)
 HEALPIX  (export HEALPIX=...)

INSTALLATION - HEALPIX-LIKE
-------------------
 Please run the ./configure command 
 and answer the questions.
 It will edit the 'Makefile'
 Then, run 'make' as usual
 'make clean' to delete .o files
 'make tidy' and 'make distclean' to uninstall
 
INSTALLATION WITH CMAKE
-------------------
  Make sure you have exported the variables
  CFITSIO, BLAS, LAPACK and HEALPIX in your PATH.
  Then just run the script './CMakeInstall'
  In case you want to clean, the Makefile is located
  in the build/ directory ('make clean', 'make tidy').

NOTE
-------------------
  3DEX is under CeCILL license, and any user must cite 
  the source and the ArXiV paper http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.3591.
  The library architecture and the installation scripts
  are directly inspired by the HEALPix package,

 > survey2almn_cxx
    You need to download the QLN table here : https://files.me.com/vladphotograph/m0krmb
    And store it in the res/ directory. 
    Or you can compute a custom table using: "bin/compute_qln_cxx res/qlnTableCustom.fits 100 50" (100 is lmax and 50 is nmax).
    Test: 
    bin/survey2almn_cxx res/qlnTable_2000_3000.fits res/params.txt out/almn.fits 256 2000 20 20 20

 > survey2almn_mpi
